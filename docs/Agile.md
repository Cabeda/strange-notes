# Agile

## Stand Ups

- Stop rambling. Go through a Kanban board.
- Prioritize ageing issues.
- Focus on blockers.
- Invite the entire team, including PMs and Designers.
- Move detailed discussions asynchronously.
- Incentivize self-management and instil psychological safety.

### Red Flags

- Stand-ups take more than 15-minutes
- People talk about their work instead of talking about goals
- People stop showing up regularly
- People talk to their manager (or “scrum master”) instead of talking to their peers
- If the manager or “scrum master” can’t show up, the stand-up doesn’t happen
