# S3

AWS's Blob storage. It provides a resiliency of 11 9's.

## Limitations

Amazon S3 supports a request rate of 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket.
If it passes this threslod it might throtle and send slow down errors.

To avoid this limitation, s3 provides `ObjectStoreLocationProvider` feature, which adds an S3 hash [0*7FFFFF] prefix in your specified S3 object path.

## Lifecycle configurations

Allows to setup some actions upoon given rules. For example:

* Transition actions – These actions define when objects transition to another storage class; for example, Amazon S3 Standard to Amazon S3 Glacier.
* Expiration actions – These actions define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.

## Amazon S3 object tagging

* Can add tags to objects to mark for deletion. S3 will proceed to delete once every night
