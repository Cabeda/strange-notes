# Reading

Types of reading:

1. Elementary - understand sentence
2. Inspectional - read cover to cover/skimming
3. Analytical - take notes and study book
4. Syntopic - compare multiple books

## Tips

- When reading an article go for 3 at least
- You should be able to take at least one bullet point
- If the insights aren't actionable they're trivia

## Code Reading

- Read the code at least twice
- Check the differences of code
- Check how the code is used
- Search for similar code
- Run the tests
- Use the debugger
- If you don't have E2E or integrations tests deploy the solution
- Don't be afraid of refactoring and adding code suggestions
