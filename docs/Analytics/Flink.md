- [Flink on Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/big-data/processing-streaming-data-in-real-time-with-apache-flink-on-amazon-kinesis-data-analytics/)
- [Flink on EC2](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/ops/deployment/aws.html)
- [Flink on ECS](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/ops/deployment/ecs.html)
- [Flink on EKS](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/ops/deployment/kubernetes.html)
