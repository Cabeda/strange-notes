- Align the company culture externally and internally: The best way to express your values is to live them with clients as well as employees.
-Measure everything and share the results: Customer and employee surveys, quarterly OKRs, real-time performance check-ins of employees and leadership.
- Open doors, always: Make sure employees have access to everyone, and feel empowered to use it. Employees can’t grow unless they speak up, and they won’t speak up unless they feel comfortable with the people they’re speaking to.
- Take professional development seriously: Employees that can make the most of expanding the breadth and depth of their skills on the job will be more engaged, more productive and less prone to burnout.
- Feedback loops go both ways: One-way feedback creates a culture of fear and approval seeking. Employees should guide the company’s growth and development as much as the other way around, and formal and informal touchpoints are essential to gather that direction.
